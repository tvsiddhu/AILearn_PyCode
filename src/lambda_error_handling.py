# Writing a lambda function you already know Some function definitions are simple enough that they can be converted
# to a lambda function. By doing this, you write fewer lines of code, which is pretty awesome and will come in handy,
# especially when you're writing and maintaining big programs. In this exercise, you will use what you know about
# lambda functions to convert a function that does a simple task into a lambda function. Take a look at this function
# definition:
#
# def echo_word(word1, echo):
# """Concatenate echo copies of word1."""
# words = word1 * echo
# return words

# The function echo_word takes 2 parameters: a string value, word1 and an integer value, echo. It returns a string
# that is a concatenation of echo copies of word1. Your task is to convert this simple function into a lambda function.

# Define echo_word as a lambda function: echo_word
echo_word = (lambda word1, echo: word1 * echo)

# Call echo_word: result
result = echo_word('hey', 5)

# Print result
print(result)

# Map() and lambda functions So far, you've used lambda functions to write short, simple functions as well as to
# redefine functions with simple functionality. The best use case for lambda functions, however, are for when you
# want these simple functionalities to be anonymously embedded within larger expressions. What that means is that the
# functionality is not stored in the environment, unlike a function defined with def. To understand this idea better,
# you will use a lambda function in the context of the map() function

# Recall from the video that map() applies a function over an object, such as a list. Here, you can use lambda functions
# to define the function that map() will use to process the object. For example:
# nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
#
# result = map(lambda a: a ** 2, nums) You can see here that a lambda function, which raises a value a to the power
# of 2, is passed to map() alongside a list of numbers, nums. The map object that results from the call to map() is
# stored in result. You will now practice the use of lambda functions with map(). For this exercise, you will map the
# functionality of the add_bangs() function you defined in previous exercises over a list of strings.

# Create a list of strings: spells
spells = ["protego", "accio", "expecto patronum", "legilimens"]

# Use map() to apply a lambda function over spells: shout_spells
shout_spells = map(lambda spell: spell + '!!!', spells)

# Convert shout_spells to a list: shout_spells_list
shout_spells_list = list(shout_spells)

# Print the result
print(shout_spells_list)

# Filter() and lambda functions In the previous exercise, you used lambda functions to anonymously embed an operation
# within map(). You will practice this again in this exercise by using a lambda function with filter(), which may be new
# to you! The function filter() offers a way to filter out elements from a list that don't satisfy certain criteria.
# To use filter(), you pass a lambda function and a list of elements to filter out. The lambda function returns a

# Create a list of strings: fellowship
fellowship = ['frodo', 'samwise', 'merry', 'pippin', 'aragorn', 'boromir', 'legolas', 'gimli', 'gandalf']

# Use filter() to apply a lambda function over fellowship: result
result = filter(lambda member: len(member) > 6, fellowship)

# Convert result to a list: result_list
result_list = list(result)

# Print result_list
print(result_list)

# Reduce() and lambda functions The reduce() function is useful for performing some computation on a list and, unlike
# map() and filter(), returns a single value as a result. To use reduce(), you must import it from the functools module.
# Remember gibberish() from a few exercises back?
#
# # Define gibberish
# def gibberish(*args):
# """Concatenate strings in *args together."""
# hodgepodge = ''
# for word in
# args: hodgepodge += word
# return hodgepodge
#
# gibberish() simply takes a list of strings as an argument and returns, as a single-value result, the concatenation
# of all of these strings. In this exercise, you will replicate this functionality by using reduce() and a lambda
# function that concatenates strings together.


# Create a list of strings: stark
stark = ['robb', 'sansa', 'arya', 'brandon', 'rickon']

# Use reduce() to apply a lambda function over stark: result
"""
The lambda function takes two string arguments and concatenates them; it is applied to the list of strings in stark. The
result is a single string that is the concatenation of all the strings in stark.
"""

result = reduce(lambda item1, item2: item1 + item2, stark)

# Print the result
print(result)


# Error handling with try-except A good practice in writing your own functions is also anticipating the ways in which
# other people (or yourself, if you accidentally misuse your own function) might use the function you defined.
# 
# As in the previous exercise, you saw that the len() function is able to handle input arguments such as strings, 
# lists, and tuples, but not int type ones and raises an appropriate error and error message when it encounters 
# invalid input arguments. One way of doing this is through exception handling with the try-except block.
# 
# In this exercise, you will define a function as well as use a try-except block for handling cases when incorrect 
# input arguments are passed to the function.
# 
# Recall the shout_echo() function you defined in previous exercises; parts of the function definition are provided 
# in the sample code. Your goal is to complete the exception handling code in the function definition and provide an 
# appropriate error message when raising an error.

# Define shout_echo
def shout_echo(word1: object, echo: object = 1) -> object:
    """Concatenate echo copies of word1 and three exclamation marks at the end of the string.
    :rtype: object
    """
    echo_word = ''
    shout_words = ''
    try:
        echo_word = word1 * echo
        shout_words = echo_word + '!!!'
    except:
        print("word1 must be a string and echo must be an integer.")
    return shout_words


# Call shout_echo
shout_echo("particle", echo="accelerator")


# Error handling by raising an error Another way to raise an error is by using raise. In this exercise, you will add
# a raise statement to the shout_echo() function you defined before to raise an error message when the value supplied
# by the user to the echo argument is less than 0.
#
# The call to shout_echo() uses valid argument values. To test and see how the raise statement works, simply change
# the value for the echo argument to a negative value. Don't forget to change it back to valid values to move on to
# the next exercise!

# Define shout_echo
def shout_echo(word1, echo=1):
    """Concatenate echo copies of word1 and three exclamation marks at the end of the string."""

    # Raise an error with raise
    if echo < 0:
        raise ValueError('echo must be greater than 0')

    echo_word = word1 * echo
    shout_word = echo_word + '!!!'
    return shout_word


# Call shout_echo
shout_echo("particle", echo=5)

# Bringing it all together (1) This is awesome! You have now learned how to write anonymous functions using lambda,
# how to pass lambda functions as arguments to other functions such as map(), filter(), and reduce(), as well as how
# to write errors and output custom error messages within your functions. You will now put together these learnings
# to good use by working with a Twitter dataset. Before practicing your new error handling skills; in this exercise,
# you will write a lambda function and use filter() to select retweets, that is, tweets that begin with the string 'RT'.
#
# To help you accomplish this, the Twitter data has been imported into the DataFrame, tweets_df. Go for it!

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Import Twitter data as DataFrame: tweets_df
tweets_df = pd.read_csv('../data/tweets.csv')

# Select retweets from the Twitter DataFrame: result
"""
In the filter() call, pass a lambda function and the sequence of tweets as strings, tweets_df['text']. The lambda
function should check if the first 2 characters in a tweet x are 'RT'. Assign the resulting filter object to result.
"""

result = filter(lambda x: x[0:2] == 'RT', tweets_df['text'])

# Create list from filter object result: res_list
res_list = list(result)

# Print all retweets in res_list
for tweet in res_list:
    print(tweet)


# Bringing it all together (2) Sometimes, we make mistakes when calling functions - even ones you made yourself.
# But don't fret! In this exercise, you will improve on your previous work with the count_entries() function in the
# last chapter by adding a try-except block to it. This will allow your function to provide a helpful message when the
# user calls your count_entries() function but provides a column name that isn't in the DataFrame.

# Once again, for your convenience, pandas has been imported as pd and the 'tweets.csv' file has been imported into
# the DataFrame tweets_df. Parts of the code from your previous work are also provided.

# Define count_entries()
def count_entries(df, col_name='lang'):

    cols_count = {}
    try:
        col = df[col_name]
        for entry in col:
            if entry in cols_count.keys():

            else:

# Call count_entries(): result1
result1 = count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang')

# Print result1
print(result1)


# Bringing it all together (3) In the previous exercise, you built on your function count_entries() to add a
# try-except block. This was so that users would get helpful messages when calling your count_entries() function and
# providing a column name that isn't in the DataFrame. In this exercise, you'll instead raise a ValueError in the
# case that the user provides a column name that isn't in the DataFrame.
